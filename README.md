# Gulmit-hunza-Valley-website-project

Visit: https://gulmit.netlify.app/

This is a simple HTML project. I created this website website when I was 15, I was truly fascinated by how these web pages work and what tag and scripts are going on behind. So, I created a website for my hometown Gulmit, Gojal Hunza, form where I hail. I have used simple HTML tags, no CSS, and JavaScript's. Have included lots of images of my hometown beauties' and history etc. One of my teacher at that time whom I won't forget about "Ms. Nasra" pushed me a lot at that time to make this thing real. So thanks for checking by, do explore through the website and know about my culture and language. Lots of love and thanks to all the coder community.   

You can dowload all the files into your system and then you can open "salmanwebsite.html" to access all the other HTML pages and other photo and vid stuffs. Other than that there's also ton of more images which can you use to enhance the website. You can add CSS, javascript etc to make the website more elegant.
You can contact me on Twitter or linked In if you have other questions regarding the project. Will love to hear your feedback.
